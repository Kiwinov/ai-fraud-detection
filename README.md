# Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions
This repository contains the source code to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

## About
The objective of this project is to identify anomalies (fraudsters) from a collection of transaction history data of different consumer bank customers. Each row corresponded to a bank account with columns describing the details regarding the account such as the list of all transactions, demography, etc.

The final accuracy achieved was 99.535% and an F1 score of 0.886, using CatBoost. Catboost was determined to be the best model after experimenting with several models such as RandomForests, SVM, Bagging, and XGBoost.
